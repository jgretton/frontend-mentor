## Overview

Your challenge is to build out this results summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. The design used was a JPEG file so i had to eye-ball the margins, text-size and padding.
This is the challenge outline :

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

### Built with

### Continued development

Moving forwards to the next challange, I plan on using what I have learned about semantic markup and accessible code with screenreaders, and implementing it to the best of my ability.
