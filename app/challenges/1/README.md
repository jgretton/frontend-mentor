## Overview

The challenge was to build out this recipe page and get it looking as close to the design as possible. The design used was a JPEG file so i had to eye-ball the margins, text-size and padding.

## My process

With this project I decided to really focus on using the correct semantic markup. I built it with mobile-first in mind.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

### What I learned

I found that taking a step back and focusing on using the correct semantic markup was a challenge. In previous projects I feel as though I just threw divs everywhere. Learning the correct use for each element was fun. My main takeaway was finding out that its okay to use `<section>` within an `<article>` element.
